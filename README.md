# Evolutionary robotics
This repository contains multiple resources related to the final project of the course "Evolutionary robotics" (taught by Professor D. Floreano), attended in the Spring semester of 2022 at EPFL. The project has been done in cooperation with Mariam Hassan, Hadrien Sprumont and LÃ©o Duggan.

The final project consisted in using evolutionary algorithms to obtain a robot able to locomote, avoid obstacles, and as stable as possible. At the end of the project, the obtained robot has been 3D-printed to verify the simulation-to-real gap. The obtained (simulated) robot is shown in the picture below:

While the 3D-printed robot is the following:

The following resources are present in the repository:
- [Evolution files folder](/Evolution%20files/), containing all files describing the robots and obtained during the different evolution steps;
- Slides of the final presentation in [PDF format](/Grand_Challenge_Slides.pdf) and in [PPTX format](/Grand_Challenge_Slides.pptx). The slides introduce in detail the procedure followed to obtain the final robot, the fitness functions used, and the obtained results.
